# Reinforcement-Learning-using-R
In this Reinforcement Learning We will use upper confidence bound and thomson sampling Algorithm 
Using this Upper Confidence bound and thomson sampling Alogorithm we will use R program to predict the best ads to publlish in different versions 
for marketing online for  A company for a B product and Let's find out the best version of Ad that is most likely to be clicked by users.
We Will use Two alogrithms Upper Confidence bound and thomson Sampling algorithm to predict the best ad version from 10 ad versions.
